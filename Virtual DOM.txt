The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM that React uses to make updates more efficient. 
It helps React figure out what needs to change on the screen without updating everything, which makes your app faster.


How It Works:
Create Virtual DOM:

React creates a copy of the real DOM in memory (Virtual DOM).
This is where React does all its work before touching the real DOM.
Detect Changes:

When something changes (like updating a button's text), React compares the new Virtual DOM with the old one to figure out exactly what changed. This process is called "diffing."
Update Real DOM:

After identifying changes, React updates only those parts of the real DOM, leaving the rest untouched.
